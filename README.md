## About The Project

Most of my experience was with JavaScript frameworks, and I had very little confidence in writing proper CSS.  
Because of that I was able to build enterprise applications, but they rarely *looked* good.

I decided to fix this by following some courses and building small projects. I started with the 
**[Frontend Masters – Complete Intro to Web Development, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/)** course by Brian Holt and challenged myself by making the final project more difficult than required.


To push my skills further I added:
- Animations  
- Functional on mobile  
- And hosted it on Github pages
